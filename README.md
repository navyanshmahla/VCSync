# VCSync

VCSync is a simple and lightweight version control system like Git. 

We'll implement all the Git commands like add, commit, push, pull, fetch, stash, rebase and a lot more! It will be a full-fledged CLI library just like Git that a person can use!

It will be implemented using Python, that's simple, however I paln to implement some of the algorithms in C++ as well.
